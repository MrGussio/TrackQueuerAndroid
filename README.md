## What is TrackQueuer?
TrackQueuer is a free-to-use application which lets other people add songs to your Spotify queue, because listening together is even more fun.
Only one user has to download the TrackQueuer-app from Google Play and you're good to go.
Share the link with your friends and let them add their favourite tracks to the queue, and the app will synchronize it with the Spotify app.
